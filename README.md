ðŸŽ“ FreeCodeCamp Certifications: Data Analysis & Machine Learning with Python
This repository contains my completed projects and exercises from the following freeCodeCamp certification courses:

Data Analysis with Python

Machine Learning with Python

ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Python
This course covers the fundamentals of data analysis using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It includes topics like:

Data cleaning and manipulation

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Working with real-world datasets

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning with Python
This course focuses on building and training machine learning models using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other tools. Topics include:

Supervised and unsupervised learning

Classification and regression
